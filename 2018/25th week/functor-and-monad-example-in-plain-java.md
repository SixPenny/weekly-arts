[functor and monad examples in plain java](http://www.nurkiewicz.com/2016/06/functor-and-monad-examples-in-plain-java.html)

This is a good artical for newbie to learn what a functor is. If you never heard about functional programing, you might get interested in it after you read it.

There is two part, as the title tells you, functor part and monad part. Monad part is a little ambigious. I don't understand what monad is. It feels like a special functor. So I googled `diffrence between functor and monad`.

Functor describes a generalisation of functions that perform mapping operations. It abstracts the data types. From view of computer-sience perspect, functor add a layer to data and give it a common `map` method to each data type. So we can use it consistently.

Monad is still ambigious to me. I will dig it continuely.
